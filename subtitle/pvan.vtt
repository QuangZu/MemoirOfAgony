00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000

<v main>Yes, you can, sir.</v>

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.000
<v evil>So, my company is recruiting for "easy work, high pay." You just need to answer customers...</v>

<v evil>...and know how to use a phone. Work 2 to 3 hours a day, and you can earn about 30 millions.</v>

<v main>I just need to know how to use a phone and technology, sir?</v>

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
<v evil>Yeah, that's right. That's all you need. If you're okay with it, you can start tomorrow.</v>

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
<v evil>But here's the thing... we currently have only one single slot left...</v>

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
<v evil>...so can you take it?</v>
