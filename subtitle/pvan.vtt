00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay, walk in.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.500
Turn on the light.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There, look around at everything for a bit.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Take off your jacket.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Get on the bed. Lie in the corner like you noticed earlier.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Alo, pick up the phone.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Okay, go to the chair.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.500
Reach down and turn on the computer.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Okay.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Hello, is this Minh? It's me, the guy from the company you just visited. Can I interview you now?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.500
Yes, you can, sir.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.000
So, my company is recruiting for "easy work, high pay." You just need to answer customers...

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.500
...and know how to use a phone. Work 2 to 3 hours a day, and you can earn about 30 millions.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.500
I just need to know how to use a phone and technology, sir?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Yeah, that's right. That's all you need. If you're okay with it, you can start tomorrow.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But here's the thing... we currently have only one single slot left...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
...so can you take it?
